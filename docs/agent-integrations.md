# Agent integrations

OpenPets reacts to coding agents. Most supported agents have an integration
package that does two jobs: **configure** the agent to talk to OpenPets, and at
runtime **translate** the agent's activity into safe pet reactions sent over
local IPC or an explicitly configured remote client. Zed is intentionally
configuration-only: it runs the MCP server but provides no lifecycle hooks of
its own. This doc covers Claude Code, MCP, OpenCode, Cursor,
Zed, Devin, Pi, OpenClaw,
and DSH, the shared speech-safety
layer, and the CLI commands that orchestrate them.

For the local and remote wire protocols, see [IPC and remote control](/ipc). Source maps live
in each `packages/*/codemap.md`.

## The shared shape

Every integration follows the same contract, which is worth internalizing once:

- **Configuration is safe and reversible.** Each integration uses a transaction
  suited to its config format. Most writes use temp-file + rename with a backup
  first; Zed settings use a sibling lock, an fsynced temp file, an exclusive
  backup, journaled claim and withdrawal artifacts, and no-clobber hard-link
  publication.
  Paths are validated against traversal/symlink escape; managed entries are
  marked so they can be detected, updated, and removed without clobbering the
  user's own config. Status is always classified
  (`missing`/`installed`/`needs-update`/`conflict`/`invalid`/…), so the UI and
  CLI can offer the right action.
- **Runtime is fire-and-forget.** Agent events are classified into a reaction
  and/or a speech category, dispatched non-blocking, and any IPC failure is
  swallowed. The pet must never slow down or break the agent.
- **Speech is always safe.** Automatic messages come from validated pools (see
  below), never from raw prompt/output text.
- **Leases route the pet.** Integrations acquire a lease on first activity,
  heartbeat it, and release on shutdown. See the lease model in [IPC and remote control](/ipc).

OpenClaw is the deliberate exception to this shared runtime shape. Its native
plugin is local-only, targets the default pet through the local client, does not
acquire a lease, and observes hook invocation without reading event arguments.

Remote mode is the explicit exception to the lease rule: it is default-pet-only
and does not acquire, heartbeat, or release leases. It is selected only through
`@open-pets/client` remote options or the named `OPENPETS_REMOTE_ENDPOINT`,
`OPENPETS_REMOTE_TOKEN`, and optional `OPENPETS_REMOTE_CLIENT_ID` environment
configuration. The client does not read local discovery in that mode. The
remote server exposes only scoped status, default-pet reactions, and optional
short safe messages; it does not accept arbitrary pet IDs, prompt/output text,
paths, files, media, installs, or discovery operations.

Remote v1 is unencrypted raw TCP. Do not use it on public Internet paths,
port-forwarded listeners, or shared/untrusted Wi-Fi; prefer an encrypted
overlay with its own ACLs. A CGNAT-range endpoint is only an allowed private
address classification, not an encryption boundary. Remote control configuration,
client pairing, token rotation, and credential revocation can be managed directly
in Control Center under Settings → Remote.

## Pet pool: multiple agents, multiple pets

By default every agent session that does not pass `--pet <id>` shares the single
default pet. The **pet pool** preference (Control Center → Settings → General,
`petPoolEnabled`, off by default) changes this so concurrent sessions each get
their own pet from a user-configured ordered list.

**How it works when enabled:**

- The user configures an ordered list of installed pets in Settings. Slot 1 is
  the primary/default pet; subsequent slots are assigned to additional concurrent
  sessions in order.
- When a new session starts without `--pet`, the lease manager assigns it the
  first pool slot not currently held by an active session.
- Once every pool slot is occupied, additional sessions are assigned a random
  eligible pet (installed, non-broken, excluding the built-in default).
- When a session ends its lease, its pet slot is freed and available to the next
  session.
- **`--pet <id>` always takes priority** and bypasses the pool entirely - unchanged from current behavior.

**Eligible pool pets** are installed, non-broken pets excluding the built-in
default. Broken or uninstalled pets are skipped silently.

**Cross-platform and agent-agnostic.** Pool assignment is pure lease logic with
no platform dependency - it works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Any agent that
acquires a lease through the shared OpenPets client benefits automatically: Claude
Code CLI, opencode, Cursor, and any other MCP client all go through the same
`lease.acquire` path.

When the pool is disabled (the default), behavior is unchanged: all sessions
without `--pet` share the single default pet.

## Safe speech: `@open-pets/agent-events`

`packages/agent-events/` is the shared guardrail. It provides curated speech
pools by category - `thinking`, `success`, `error`, `permission` - and the
validators that keep messages safe: single line, 1–140 chars, and rejecting
code, URLs, file paths, and secret-like tokens. `pickHookSpeech(category)`
selects a message; `validateHookSpeech()` enforces the rules. `claude`,
`opencode`, and `pi` all depend on it so no integration can leak sensitive text
into a bubble.

## Claude Code - `@open-pets/claude`

The deepest integration, because Claude Code has a rich hook system.

- **MCP setup** (`claude-code.ts`): registers an MCP server named `openpets`
  using `claude mcp add/get/remove`. Command modes: `published`
  (`npx -y @open-pets/mcp`), `local`, `bundled` (ASAR-unpacked path). Paths are
  validated to stay within expected directories. Packaged builds default to
  `bundled` but honor an explicit `published` choice, and command probing
  includes fnm default-alias directories plus the standard Windows npm
  global shim directory, so version-manager installs and globally
  installed CLIs resolve without shell profile evaluation.
- **Hooks** (`hook-settings.ts` + `hooks.ts`): installs command hooks into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` for the lifecycle events `UserPromptSubmit`,
  `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`. Each
  managed entry carries the `--openpets-managed` marker. `runClaudeHookFromStdin()`
  maps an event to a reaction: prompt submit → thinking, permission → waiting,
  stop → success, stop-failure → error, and `PreToolUse` is classified by tool
  (Edit/Write/MultiEdit → editing, Bash test commands → testing).
- **Project-local awareness**: if a project defines its own OpenPets hook
  (`.claude/settings.local.json` with `--project-local`), the global hook stands
  down to avoid double-firing.
- **Throttling**: ~20s speech / ~3s permission / ~10s reaction cooldowns via a
  JSON state file, so the pet doesn't chatter.
- **Memory**: the desktop's `claude-memory.ts` manages `~/.claude/openpets.md`
  (the instructions file telling Claude how to use the pet).

Doctor/install/uninstall helpers (`installClaudeHooks`, `doctorClaudeHooks`, …)
are what the Control Center Integrations page and the CLI call.

## MCP server - `@open-pets/mcp`

A standalone stdio MCP server (`open-pets-mcp`) for any MCP-capable agent. It
registers exactly three tools - `openpets_status`, `openpets_react`,
`openpets_say` - with Zod-validated input and read-only/idempotent annotations.
On startup it acquires a lease, heartbeats every ~5s, and releases on transport
close or SIGINT/SIGTERM. Shutdown marks the shared lease context as closing,
stops timers, waits for in-flight startup and single-flight recovery from either
the heartbeat timer or a reaction/say tool, then best-effort releases every
retained lease ID exactly once before closing the server and exiting. A heartbeat
failure that arrives after closing begins cannot erase the active lease needed
for teardown; a failure just before closing retains its stale ID alongside any
eventual recovery lease. No new recovery acquisition starts after teardown
begins, so an agent that replaces an MCP process cannot leave a temporary second
pool pet behind. Errors are sanitized so IPC paths/tokens/sockets never leak
into tool output. It is spawned by the CLI (`runMcp()`) which forwards stdio and
signals. `--pet <id>` targets a specific pet.

> **Window confinement requires an installed pet.** Passing `--pet <id>` only
> activates window confinement when the requested pet is actually installed. If
> the pet ID is misspelled or not yet installed, the MCP server silently falls
> back to the default (unconfined) pet. OpenPets now surfaces this via a desktop
> notification when the fallback occurs. To list installed pets run
> `openpets pets`; to install one use `openpets install <pet-id>` or the Pets
> tab in Control Center.

## OpenCode - `@open-pets/opencode`

Ships both a config manager and a runtime plugin.

- **Config** (`opencode-config.ts`, JSONC-aware): manages `mcp`, `instructions`,
  and `plugin` arrays in the effective OpenCode config (project `.opencode/` or
  global `~/.config/opencode/`), choosing the right file among `config.json` /
  `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc` and preserving user arrays. Managed
  instruction blocks use `<!-- OPENPETS:START/END -->` markers. Full
  prepare/write/remove/doctor lifecycle. OpenCode uses the XDG-style
  `~/.config/opencode/` location on Windows as well; it does not use
  `%APPDATA%\opencode`.
- **Path safety** (`opencode-path-safety.ts`): OpenPets never follows or
  overwrites symlinks when writing OpenCode config or instruction files.
  Atomic temp-file + rename writes stay inside the validated root with backups,
  and symlink/parent rejections name the offending path, its resolved target
  when safely obtainable, and the project-local remediation. To fix a symlinked
  global config, materialize the symlink as a regular file or use project-local
  setup instead.
- **CLI surfaces**: `openpets configure --agent opencode` writes project-local
  `.opencode/` files by default; `openpets configure --agent opencode --global`
  writes the shared global config through the same preparation path as desktop
  setup. `openpets doctor` reports global OpenCode status read-only and exits
  non-zero on genuine diagnostic errors.
- **Runtime** (`opencode-plugin-runtime.ts`, plugin id `open-pets-opencode`):
  hooks `event`, `chat.message`, `tool.execute.before/after`, classifies them to
  reactions/speech, manages a lease (renew with a 2s buffer), and applies the
  same throttle windows as Claude. The optional `excludeReactions` plugin option is an
  array of reactions to suppress before IPC or throttling. It can be used without a
  `pet` target: `["@open-pets/opencode", { "excludeReactions": ["success", "thinking"] }]`.
- **Windows detection**: the desktop app checks user and global Scoop shim
  directories before falling back to `opencode` / `opencode.cmd` on `PATH`, so
  a Scoop installation is detectable even when Electron inherited an older
  environment.

## Cursor - `@open-pets/cursor`

Pure file management for Cursor, no runtime hooks (Cursor drives the pet via the
MCP server). It manages the `openpets` entry in `mcp.json` (global
`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or project `.cursor/mcp.json`) and optional project rules at
`.cursor/rules/openpets.mdc`. Strong safety posture: strict JSON only, size caps
(256 KiB config / 64 KiB rules), symlink rejection at every path level, atomic
writes with backup, recursive redaction of sensitive keys/values, and refusal of
unpinned versions (`@latest`). Rules ownership requires an exact
`OPENPETS:CURSOR_RULES:START/END` marker pair. The desktop uses preview/copy;
the CLI writes project rules.

## Zed - `@open-pets/zed`

Pure global settings management for Zed, with no runtime hooks of its own. It
manages the `openpets` entry in Zed's global `settings.json` under
`context_servers`, using JSONC-aware targeted edits so comments, trailing
commas, unrelated settings, and other context servers survive. The settings
path is `~/.config/zed/settings.json` on macOS, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zed/settings.json`
on Linux/FreeBSD (with `FLATPAK_XDG_CONFIG_HOME` taking precedence), and
`%APPDATA%\Zed\settings.json` on Windows.

The package supports pinned published MCP commands (`npx -y
@open-pets/mcp@VERSION`), plus local and bundled Node entry paths (using the
desktop's configured Node.js command when applicable). It reports
`missing`, `installed`, `disabled`, `needs-update`, `conflict`, `invalid`, and
`error` states, refuses unsafe or ambiguous mutations, strips unsupported
`remote` execution during correction while preserving managed environment and
timeout fields, and requires explicit replacement to re-enable a disabled entry.
Configured Node.js paths are validated through their resolved executable but
stored in their original safe form so version-manager symlinks continue to
follow upgrades.
Planned writes are rejected when the settings file changes before execution.
The desktop Control Center manages the same status-aware lifecycle through
`apps/desktop/src/agent-setup.ts`; the CLI
manages the global file with `openpets configure --agent zed`. Both paths use
the package's journaled, crash-recoverable write APIs rather than editing JSONC
directly. Existing settings remain in place while their verified backup is
prepared; publication uses a temporary claim and no-clobber hard link, and an
interrupted claim is restored from the journal on the next attempt. Ambiguous
recovery state is rejected rather than guessed.

## Devin - `@open-pets/devin`

Global MCP config and lifecycle-hook management for Devin.
Devin Desktop (the editor formerly called Windsurf) and the Devin CLI read the
same user-scope MCP file, so one managed `mcpServers.openpets` entry serves
both. The path is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devin/mcp_config.json` when
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, otherwise `~/.config/devin/mcp_config.json` on macOS
and Linux, and `%APPDATA%\devin\mcp_config.json` on Windows. OpenPets does not
write project `.devin/mcp_config.json` files or the legacy
`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`.

The entry uses Devin's stdio schema (`command` + `args`, no `type` field): a
pinned `npx -y @open-pets/mcp@VERSION [--pet <id>]`, or for local/bundled
command modes the configured Node.js command running the OpenPets MCP entry
script. Edits are JSONC-aware targeted edits, so comments, trailing commas,
unrelated servers, and other top-level settings survive. Updating an entry
OpenPets already manages changes only `command` and `args` (and clears
`disabled` on replace), so user fields such as `env` survive. Writes refuse
symlinked paths, back up the previous file byte-for-byte, stage the content in
an exclusive temp file, and are rejected if the file changed after planning
(for example, through `devin mcp add`), checked right before the atomic rename.
Status is `missing`,
`installed`, `disabled` (a managed entry with `"disabled": true`, which install
never re-enables silently; replace does), `needs-update`, `conflict` (an
`openpets` server OpenPets does not manage, which needs an explicit replace and
is never removed), `invalid`, or `error`.

### Devin hooks

The two Devin products have separate hook systems, and OpenPets manages both
(`devin-hooks.ts`), always as the same command,
`openpets hook --openpets-managed --agent devin [--pet <id>]` (pinned
`npx -y @open-pets/cli@VERSION ...`, or Node.js plus the bundled/local CLI
entry):

| Product | File | Events (reaction) |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Devin CLI (Devin Local agent) | `hooks` key of `~/.config/devin/config.json` (`%APPDATA%\devin\config.json`), Claude Code-compatible format, 5 s timeout | `UserPromptSubmit` (thinking), `PreToolUse` matched to `edit`/`write`/`apply_patch`/`notebook_edit`/`exec` (editing, or testing for test commands), `PermissionRequest` (waiting + permission speech), `Stop` (success) |
| Devin Desktop (Cascade) | `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json` | `pre_user_prompt` (thinking), `post_write_code` (editing), `pre_run_command` (testing for test commands), `post_cascade_response` (success) |

`devin-hook-events.ts` maps both payload families from event and tool names
only; prompt, code, response, and output text are never read or forwarded.
The CLI runtime (`packages/cli/src/devin-hook.ts`) always exits 0, ignores
oversized (>4 MiB) or malformed input, and sends the decision through the
Claude package's shared `dispatchHookDecision()` (lease, validated canned
speech, throttling). Hook edits reuse the same JSONC-preserving safe-write
transaction as the MCP entry, replace only hooks whose command carries
`--openpets-managed --agent devin`, and drop emptied event arrays. Hooks
report `installed` only when every required event holds exactly one current
OpenPets hook. On Windows,
Devin Desktop entries whose command starts with a quoted executable also get a
`powershell` variant using the call operator.

Devin CLI also loads Claude Code hooks from `~/.claude/settings.json` by
default (`read_config_from.claude`). If OpenPets Claude Code hooks are installed
too, both fire in Devin CLI; the shared throttle file suppresses most
duplicate reactions.

The desktop Control Center manages MCP and hooks through
`apps/desktop/src/agent-setup-devin.ts` (hooks are an optional section of the
Devin dialog; install/remove apply to both products). The CLI configures MCP
and both hook files with `openpets configure --agent devin` (`--force`
replaces conflicting or disabled MCP entries). After a change, refresh MCP
servers in Devin Desktop or start a new Devin CLI session or Desktop
conversation.

## Pi - `@open-pets/pi`

A Pi coding-agent extension (declared in `pi.extensions`). It maps Pi lifecycle
events (`session_start`, `agent_start`, `turn_start`, …) to reactions and
registers a `/openpets` slash command namespace (`status`, `test`,
`react <reaction>`, `say <message>`). MVP scope is default-pet-only and
non-blocking; it registers **no** model-callable tools, and never forwards
prompt/assistant/tool/command text, paths, URLs, or secrets.

## OpenClaw - `@open-pets/openclaw`

OpenClaw is a native OpenClaw plugin, not an OpenPets SDK v3 catalog plugin and
not an MCP configuration. The published package contains the compiled runtime
and the native `openclaw.plugin.json` manifest. Its package metadata points
OpenClaw at `dist/index.js` through `openclaw.extensions`; the default export is
the `openpets` plugin entry created with OpenClaw's `definePluginEntry()`.
The manifest declares startup activation and an empty inline configuration
schema, so OpenClaw can inventory the plugin before loading its runtime.

### Exact runtime contract

The plugin registers only these OpenClaw lifecycle hooks. Both handlers are
argument-free by contract; the integration never reads model, tool, prompt,
result, path, or other hook payloads.

| OpenClaw hook | OpenPets effect |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `model_call_started` | `thinking`: a curated thinking speech may be sent, subject to the speech cooldown; otherwise the thinking reaction is sent. |
| `before_tool_call` | `working` reaction. |

Dispatch is scheduled and non-blocking. It uses a local-only OpenPets client
with bounded connection/response timeouts, and automatic failures do not reach
OpenClaw. There are **no terminal success or error hooks**: the integration does
not emit success/error feedback when a model or tool call finishes. It also does
not forward arbitrary OpenClaw text to the pet.

### Native package and lifecycle commands

OpenPets manages the owned package at the exact workspace package version. The
underlying OpenClaw commands are:

```sh
openclaw plugins install npm:@open-pets/openclaw@<version>
openclaw plugins enable openpets
openclaw plugins update @open-pets/openclaw@<version>
openclaw plugins uninstall openpets --force
```

The install must remain an npm-tracked `@open-pets/openclaw` installation. A
different source using the `openpets` id is a conflict rather than something
OpenPets silently replaces.

Use OpenClaw's inventory commands when inspecting the installation directly:

```sh
openclaw plugins list --json
openclaw plugins inspect openpets --json
openclaw plugins inspect openpets --runtime --json
```

`list` and ordinary `inspect` are cold inventory reads. They can establish what
OpenClaw's persisted registry and manifest metadata say, but **cold inventory
cannot prove that a running Gateway loaded the plugin**. `inspect --runtime`
performs a separate runtime inspection pass; after install, update, enablement,
or entry/config changes, restart the Gateway and verify the actual Gateway
process separately.

### Status states and ownership

The desktop and CLI classify the same OpenClaw observations into these states:

An OpenClaw executable installed in a nonstandard location is supported when
the user supplies its absolute executable path in the Control Center. That is
different from a nonstandard plugin source: the `openpets` id remains owned
only when its tracked install is the `@open-pets/openclaw` npm package.

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `installed-enabled` / `installed-disabled` | The owned npm installation is present and OpenClaw reports its enablement. |
| `not-installed` | OpenClaw is supported and the owned plugin is absent. |
| `unavailable` | The configured OpenClaw executable is missing or does not report a version. |
| `unsupported-host` | The host is outside the supported desktop platforms, or OpenClaw is older than the supported `2026.7.1` minimum. |
| `management-disabled` | OpenPets itself sees `OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1`; Nix owns the plugin files/configuration, so OpenPets does not mutate them. OpenClaw currently exposes no machine-readable Nix-mode status to a separate parent process. |
| `conflict` | Plugin id `openpets` is present but its source is not the tracked npm `@open-pets/openclaw` package. |
| `invalid` | OpenClaw returned incomplete plugin metadata or reports a load/dependency problem for the owned installation. |
| `indeterminate` | A list/inspect or post-action status refresh failed or returned malformed data; no mutation should be retried based on this state alone. |

The **Control Center** is the desktop-owned setup surface. The main process
resolves the configured `openclaw` executable, reads version/list/inspect
status, presents command previews, and owns install, update, enable-as-part-of-
setup, and remove actions through the agent-setup IPC boundary. It reports known Nix,
unsupported, conflict, invalid, and indeterminate states instead of treating
them as installable.

The **OpenPets CLI** exposes the global ensure flow as:

```sh
openpets configure --agent openclaw
```

Only `--yes` is meaningful for this target. OpenClaw setup does not accept
`--cwd`, `--pet`, `--force`, `--local-dev`, or Cursor rules flags. The CLI
discovers version/list/inspect, plans install-or-update followed by enable, and
refreshes status after each command before declaring success. It has no separate
OpenPets `list`, `inspect`, or `remove` subcommand for OpenClaw; use the native
OpenClaw commands above for direct inventory or lower-level lifecycle control.
OpenClaw remains the owner of its plugin registry and Gateway restart lifecycle.

## DSH - `@open-pets/dsh`

Install the strict local-only v1 DSH plugin for a DSH profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add @open-pets/dsh
```

Or mount into user configuration patch (`~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: plugin-openpets-dsh
      name: '@open-pets/dsh'
      disabled: false
      config:
        enabled: true
        minSpeechIntervalMs: 1200
        enableStatusLineStream: true
        enableToolEvents: true
        enableApprovalEvents: true
```

The plugin can be toggled on or off at the Cordis loader level (`disabled: true/false`) or dynamically via plugin config (`enabled: false/true`).

`@open-pets/dsh` is a Cordis bundle that automatically maps DSH lifecycle
events to OpenPets reactions:

DSH always uses local IPC and the default pet, and ignores remote configuration.

| DSH event | OpenPets reaction | Speech / Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `running` (`agent/status`) | `thinking` | Curated thinking speech |
| `idle` (`agent/status`) | `success` | Curated success speech (suppressed for 5s after error) |
| `error` (`agent/error`) | `error` | Curated error speech |
| `approval/request` | `waiting` | Curated permission speech |
| `agent/assistant-stream` | `working` | Sanitized `⏵` status line |
| `tools/result (bash)` | `running` | Sanitized tool description |
| `tools/result (edit, write)` | `editing` | Sanitized file action |
| `tools/result (read)` | `working` | Sanitized file read action |

Automatic dispatch is non-blocking and uses only curated categorical speech or sanitized status text.
The bundle never forwards prompts, full tool payloads, raw results, full paths, URLs,
secrets, or arbitrary event text. Idle/success is briefly suppressed after an
error so the error state remains visible. DSH adds no model tools or MCP setup;
the existing OpenPets MCP integration remains separately configurable.

## The CLI - `@open-pets/cli`

The user-facing front door (`openpets`), and the package that composes the
others. Commands:

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `configure` | Configure Claude / OpenCode / Cursor for a project, OpenCode globally with `--global`, Zed or Devin globally, or ensure the global OpenClaw plugin is installed and enabled |
| `doctor` | Read-only diagnostics for Claude hooks, Cursor project MCP, global OpenCode setup, and app reachability (human and `--json` output) |
| `install <pet-id>` | Install a pet via the client |
| `status` | Print app/pet status JSON over IPC |
| `pets` | List installed pets |
| `react <reaction>` / `say <message>` | Drive the active pet |
| `mcp` | Launch the MCP stdio server |
| `hook` | Run a Claude Code lifecycle hook, or a Devin CLI / Devin Desktop hook with `--agent devin` |
| `plugin validate <dir>` | Validate a plugin before install/release |
| `plugin new <name> --template <t>` | Scaffold an SDK v3 plugin |

The plugin subcommands are the author-side DX entry point - see
[Plugin platform](/plugins), [Plugin SDK v3](/sdk), and [Development](/development).
The CLI enforces safe project paths and atomic config writes throughout.

The CLI's `status`, `react`, and `say` commands also work with an explicitly
configured remote client because they use the shared client factory. Remote
credentials are consumed in memory and are not included in command output.
The MCP wrapper skips local lease setup in remote mode and sends only the three
remote-allowlisted operations; local users with no remote configuration retain
discovery-based behavior unchanged.

## Quick orientation
