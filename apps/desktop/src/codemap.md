# apps/desktop/src/

## Responsibility

Core TypeScript source for the OpenPets desktop application. Organized into: lifecycle management, state persistence, Control Center and pet windows, IPC server, agent integrations, pet installation/management, and declarative plus JavaScript plugin runtimes.

## Design/Patterns

- **Modular Controllers**: Separate controllers for default pet vs agent pets (lease-based)
- **Protocol-First IPC**: Versioned JSON protocol over TCP/Unix sockets with token auth
- **Defensive I/O**: All file operations use temp+rename for atomicity, path traversal validation, symlink checks
- **Validation at Boundaries**: Catalog, ZIP entries, pet metadata, and IPC params all strictly validated
- **Lease Pattern**: Agent pets use expiring leases (15s TTL) with heartbeats; default pet is persistent
- **Sandboxed Renderers**: Control Center loads the Vite React/Tailwind bundle through a hardened BrowserWindow and narrow preload bridge; transparent pet windows and plugin SDK host windows stay separate
- **Structured Logging**: Scoped logging (app, ipc, lease, pet.*, state, tray, ui, voice, provider) with log rotation and redaction
- **Reaction Animation Mapping**: User-configurable mapping from reaction types to sprite animation states
- **Plugin Runtimes**: Plugins use validated manifests, approved permissions, persisted config, safe path checks, declarative timer-triggered actions, or sandboxed JavaScript entry modules through the SDK bridge.
- **Capability-Oriented SDK Surface**: The plugin bridge is split into focused SDK modules for audio, bus, config, events, quotas, routes, state, storage, types, and UI so permission checks and host effects stay localized.
- **Host-Rendered Plugin UI**: Plugins describe bubbles, alerts, commands, panels, assets, and pet behavior; the host validates descriptors and renders them through pet windows, Control Center IPC, or sandboxed panel windows.
- **Localized Runtime Content**: `i18n/` and plugin locale catalogs resolve host UI text, pet reaction messages, and plugin `$t:` strings through fallback-aware message catalogs.
- **Motion Engine Abstraction**: Advanced pet movement uses a small physics/interpolation engine rather than embedding movement math in window or SDK routing code.

## Data & Control Flow

**Main Process Flow**:
```
bootstrap.ts (Electron package entry)
├── startup-backend-policy.ts (pre-main platform/argv/environment plan; selects launch or replacement-process argv)
└── main.ts (application bootstrap after backend selection)
    ├── lifecycle.ts (app events, cleanup)
    ├── logger.ts (structured logging init)
    ├── app-state.ts (state init)
    ├── pet-install-transaction.ts (startup recovery of interrupted pet commits)
    ├── codex-pet-migration.ts (safe legacy V2 marker repair)
    ├── plugin-service.ts (plugin state/runtime init, JS host wiring)
    ├── manager-check-in-service.ts (bundled weekly sync, local-week offer state, and pet snapshot)
    ├── tray.ts (tray creation)
    ├── local-ipc.ts (IPC server start)
    ├── control-center-route.ts (canonical route/target validation and dev-only startup routing)
    └── windows.ts (UI handlers)
```

**IPC Request Flow**:
```
local-ipc.ts → local-ipc-request-handler.ts → parseIpcRequest() → handleRequest()
├── hello/status/pets.list/pets.install
└── lease.acquire/heartbeat/release
    └── lease-manager.ts
        ├── resolveTarget() (default vs explicit pet)
        ├── onFirstExplicitLease → agent-pet-controller.showAgentPet()
        └── onLastExplicitLease → agent-pet-controller.closeAgentPetIfOpen()
    └── local-ipc-confinement.ts → confinement-poller.ts → window-tracker.ts
└── Logging via logger.ts (ipc, lease scopes)
```

**Pet Display Flow**:
```

**LAN visiting-pet flow**: with `OPENPETS_LAN_PETS=multi`, each client
registers its selected default pet through `lan-http-controller.ts`.
`lan-controller.ts` reports positions for every pet currently hosted locally
and reconciles coordinator snapshots through `lan-pet-controller.ts`.
Visiting windows are keyed by owner host, use `lan-pet-presence.ts` for pure
show/close and asset-availability decisions, and stay isolated from agent
leases. The bundled pet can render explicitly for fresh-profile LAN testing;
missing or broken catalog assets are skipped without stopping LAN polling.
`lan-pet-activity.ts` gates coarse work signals to active meetings and plans
single-use visitor departures. `lan-pet-controller.ts` renders the built-in
return line plus `running` animation before `lan-controller.ts` requests the
coordinator return the visitor to its owner.
Registration also issues a random per-host session credential:
`lan-controller.ts` presents it for later position, claim, activity, and return
mutations, while `lan-http-controller.ts` rejects shared-token peers that claim
another active host identity.

```

X11/XWayland pet windows remain focusable for chat and plugin inputs. The
pre-show lifecycle subscribes to structure events and prepares `_NET_WM_STATE`;
after MapNotify it sends EWMH add-state requests and watches the property until
the standard taskbar/pager atoms, and the KDE switcher atom when advertised by
root `_NET_SUPPORTED`, are present. This is pet-window-only (not Control Center)
and does not cover experimental native Wayland. Property verification is not
proof of compositor UI behavior or no visible flash.

**Manager Check-in Flow**:
```
team-api-client.ts → manager-check-in-service.ts → manager-check-in-state.ts
├── syncs organization settings, employee history, visibility disclosure, and device-private pause state
├── computes the enrolled desktop's local-week due/pending state
├── due weekly offer → default-pet-controller.ts → private pet bubble and local action circle beside Chat/Talk
└── default-pet-chat.ts / pet-preload.cjs → in-pet card
    ├── five fixed feelings, optional 500-character note, visible organization disclosure
    ├── explicit submission only; close/cancel has no submission or telemetry
    └── client-generated ID makes ambiguous retries idempotent; success clears the local action for the week
```

The Teams Control Center route consumes Manager Check-in sync, immutable history,
and pause/resume controls. It does not collect or submit a check-in. Manager
Check-ins remains a bundled weekly feature rather than a Team Pack, plugin,
generic task, notification, or cadence platform.

`pet-display-coordinator.ts` owns display-topology and power-resume events and
fans out to the default, agent, LAN visitor, and plugin reclamp leaves.

## Key Modules

**Core**:
- `bootstrap.ts`: Package-entry pre-main backend bootstrap; uses `startup-backend-policy.ts` and starts a normalized replacement with Node `child_process.spawn` when needed, waits up to 15 seconds for a bounded ready/failure IPC handoff, supervises unpackaged replacements with signal/exit propagation, and detaches packaged replacements
- `startup-backend-policy.ts`: Pure platform/argv/environment policy for normal X11, Wayland opt-out, and native layer-shell startup selection
- `main.ts`: Application bootstrap after backend selection, single-instance lock, JavaScript plugin host construction, and dev-only Control Center route opening
- `lifecycle.ts`: App event handlers (quit, window-all-closed, second-instance) with logging; stops plugin service, IPC, and pet windows on quit
- `state.ts`: Simple shell pause state
- `app-state.ts`: Persistent JSON state with V1 schema, atomic writes, reaction animation overrides, validated waiting animation duration, persisted idle cursor-gaze preference, and host Pet Assistant personality preferences
- `default-pet-position-state.ts`: Electron-free default-pet position shape, coordinate/display-key normalization, and bounded per-monitor LRU updates
- `app-state-core.ts`: Pet scale options, waiting-duration options/normalization, idle cursor-gaze default/normalization, onboarding normalization

- `manager-check-in-service.ts`: Bundled weekly Manager Check-ins lifecycle; synchronizes organization settings/history, computes local-week due state, presents a history-free pet snapshot, owns explicit submission and idempotent retry behavior, and keeps pause state device-private
- `manager-check-in-state.ts`: Atomic local Manager Check-ins state with bounded history, pending client-generated submission identity, local-week offer/submission markers, and scheduled-offer pause
- `team-api-client.ts`: Teams enrollment, Team Pack, and Manager Check-ins API adapter; validates fixed feelings and bounded submissions, while the pet card enforces its 500-character note limit and client-generated IDs provide idempotent immutable retries
- `logger.ts`: Structured logging with scopes (app, ipc, lease, pet.default, pet.agent, pet.window, state, tray, ui, voice, provider), log rotation, redaction

**UI**:
- `tray.ts`: Tray icon (nativeImage), context menu builder, update status integration, route-targeted Control Center entries, logs folder
- `external-url-opener.ts`: Shared ordinary external-browser opener; uses Linux `xdg-open` with `GDK_BACKEND` removed from a copied environment, force-terminates only the owned launcher after a 10-second timeout, and preserves caller URL policy
- `external-url-opener-core.ts`: Electron-free platform/environment policy for external-browser opening; bounds launcher wait, avoids ambiguous-success fallback on timeout, and retains shell fallback for ordinary launcher errors

- `default-pet-chat.ts`: Host-side in-pet chat coordinator, handling attached chat expansion, dynamic panel height synchronization, IPC dispatch, conversation transcript streams, talk status, and prompt suggestions
- `default-pet-chat-geometry.ts`: Bijective coordinate mappings and anchor-preserving window bounds for collapsed, expanded-chat (420x640), and pet-scale-derived session carrier states, plus bottom-relative panel positioning and session orb/window sizing calculations
- `pet-session-overlay.ts`: Practice session overlay coordinator for the `ui:session` plugin surface — owns the single active session descriptor (breathing or PMR; tracks the overlay's pattern pick as the live selection) the per-practice carrier height hint, and the renderer-measured carrier height (card + orb) the carrier then fits, host-localized chrome strings, plugin-driven pause/resume/stop controls, in-place same-plugin session replacement without carrier flicker, practice-switch event relay to the owning plugin, the Info window lifecycle, and carrier open/replace/displacement/close lifecycles
- `session-media-cache.ts`: Host-owned cache for player-session media — downloads each approved-host https segment once via `safeHttpFetchBytes`, keeps it under userData (LRU cap), and serves it on the privileged `openpets-session-media:` scheme
- `session-icons.ts`: Stroke-only SVG paths for the allowlisted session icon names, shared by the Info window and (via the coordinator's renderer payload) the pet overlay's practice picker and grounding senses
- `pet-session-info-window.ts`: Host-rendered, script-free session Info window (logo header, mechanism/science cards with allowlisted study links, checklists, citations, disclaimer, site attribution) built from the validated descriptor
- `plugin-session-descriptor.ts`: Pure validation and types for the practice session overlay descriptor union (breathing patterns/phases vs PMR 10s tense/release steps and cues vs self-paced grounding senses with items, practice-switching options, Info content with sections/items/cards, https-only links, manifest logo ref)
- `window-tracker-latch.ts`: Re-entrancy latch helper (`createLatchedTick`) that prevents overlapping async ticks from stacking; used by the window-tracking poller
- `renderer/`: Vite React/Tailwind Control Center shell for Dashboard, Pets, Integrations, Plugins, and Settings.

**Pets**:
- `pet-window.ts`: Public pet-window lifecycle facade: transparent frameless window creation, HTML/CSS composition, sprite and transient presentation updates, gaze configuration, and plugin scale override updates; companion launcher, attached chat styling, bubble suppression, status badges, validated atlas layout selection, context-menu installation delegation, and Linux X11 show/hide gating
- `pet-content-stage.cjs`: Pet-preload DOM stage replacement and renderer-side retention/application of the host-owned scale override to the currently rendered sprite
- `x11-pet-window-state.ts`: X11 client adapter that subscribes to StructureNotify before show, waits for matching MapNotify, sends post-map EWMH state additions, and observes `_NET_WM_STATE` until standard exclusion atoms and the KDE switcher atom when advertised by root `_NET_SUPPORTED` are present
- `x11-pet-window-state-core.ts`: Electron-free EWMH atom/property helpers for merging existing state and checking required atoms
- `pet-window-x11-map-core.ts`: Electron-free matching/cancellation state for the target window's MapNotify transition
