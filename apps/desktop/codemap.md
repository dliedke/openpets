## Responsibility

OpenPets desktop companion application. Tray-first Electron app providing animated desktop pets that react to coding agent events. Manages pet installations, the React/Tailwind Control Center, plugin automation/runtime, agent integrations (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Zed, Pi guidance, and OpenClaw management), and local IPC for CLI communication.

## Design

- **Tray-First UX**: No default main window; tray actions open the singleton React/Tailwind Control Center and route directly to Dashboard, Pets, Integrations, Plugins, Settings, and Teams.
- **Single Instance**: Uses `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` with second-instance focusing
- **Security Model**: 
  - Sandboxed renderers with contextIsolation
  - Preload scripts expose limited APIs via `contextBridge`
  - CSP: `default-src 'none'`, inline styles only
  - Mock keychain to prevent OS credential prompts
  - IPC network security: loopback/private address filtering for TCP mode
- **State Management**: File-based JSON state with atomic writes (temp + rename), including bounded Pet Assistant personality preferences and a separate host-owned local conversation archive
- **Pet Architecture**: 
  - Default pet (always visible when enabled)
  - Agent pets (lease-based, appear on explicit agent requests)
  - Built-in fallback pet (bundled spritesheet)
  - Speech bubbles with reaction messages and status badges
  - User-configurable reaction-to-animation mapping
- **Lease Manager**: 15s TTL leases for agent pet routing with heartbeat renewal
- **Logging**: Structured logging with scopes, including `voice` and `provider`, log rotation (2MB max), and sensitive data redaction
- **Plugin Subsystem**: Declarative manifest plugins and JavaScript plugin hosting with permission approval, config schemas, command/status surfaces, catalog/local installs, SDK bridge quotas, storage, schedules, restricted HTTPS fetch, and safe path/ZIP/manifest validation
- **Manager Check-ins**: Bundled weekly organization feature with a private pet-native action circle and in-pet submission card; Control Center is limited to sync, immutable history, and local pause/resume controls

## Flow

**Startup**: `main.ts` → `installAppLifecycle()` → `initializeLogger()` → `initializeAppState()` → safely repair eligible legacy Codex V2 import markers → `createAppTray()` → start `PetDisplayCoordinator` → `startLocalIpcServer()` → initialize plugin service with JavaScript host/SDK bridge → start bundled `ManagerCheckInService` and subscribe the default pet → construct Pet Assistant host and local conversation archive → optionally open a validated `OPENPETS_DEV_ROUTE` Control Center route in unpackaged development → optionally `showDefaultPet()`

**Pet Display**: IPC Request → `local-ipc.ts` → `LeaseManager.acquire()` → `agent-pet-controller.ts` → `pet-window.ts` → HTML/CSS spritesheet animation with reaction-to-animation mapping; topology and resume recovery are coordinated by `pet-display-coordinator.ts`

**Installation**: Catalog fetch (V3 with pagination fallback to V2) → ZIP download → `yauzl` extraction → validation → `pet-install-transaction.ts` orchestrates filesystem promotion, state mutation, rollback, recovery, and side effects using the pure `pet-install-transaction-protocol.ts` journal/schema/naming/recovery policy → tray refresh

**Agent Setup**: UI → `agent-setup.ts` → Claude/OpenCode/Cursor/Zed/Devin setup or OpenClaw version/list/inspect discovery → MCP/config/hooks changes or native OpenClaw install/update/enable/remove → post-action status refresh

**Control Center**: Tray route → `openControlCenterWindow(route)` → `windows.ts` loads Vite renderer and sends route events → `control-center-preload.cjs` exposes narrow page APIs → React Dashboard/Pets/Integrations/Plugins/Settings/Teams routes render snapshots and invoke actions, including host-owned personality preferences, conversation archive management (list, single-delete, clear), atomic provider configuration saves, and Manager Check-ins sync/history/pause controls. Manager Check-in submission is owned by the private pet card, not Control Center.

**Plugins**: Control Center plugins route → `plugin-service.ts` → catalog or local manifest/entry loader → permission approval/state update → `plugin-runtime.ts` schedules declarative timers or starts `plugin-js-host.ts` → `plugin-sdk-bridge.ts` applies approved SDK calls to pet/schedule/storage/command/status/network APIs
